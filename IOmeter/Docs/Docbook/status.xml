<para>
Whenever you press the Start Tests button, Iometer runs a series of tests, 
as specified by the Access Specifications and Test Setup tabs. Each access 
specification is run once; each test is run once for each access 
specification. The current test number and the total number of tests to be 
run are displayed in the status bar at the bottom of the Iometer window.

For example, if there are two access specifications selected for each 
worker in the Access Specifications tab and two tests specified by the 
Test Setup tab (see the description of the Cycling Options control group 
for information on determining the number of tests), Iometer will run a 
total of four tests:

<listitem><para>
Access specification #1, test #2 (shown as Run 2 of 4)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Access specification #2, test #2 (shown as Run 4 of 4)
</para></listitem></orderedlist>
<para>
Each test runs for the time specified by the Run Time control group in the 
Test Setup tab. If the run time is set to zero, each test runs until you 
press the Stop button.

The status bar may also display other messages, such as <emphasis>Test 
Aborted</emphasis> or <emphasis>Preparing Drives</emphasis>. The 
Preparing Drives message indicates that the iobw.tst file is being created 
on a logical drive, as described in the Disk Targets Tab section (add 
link).
