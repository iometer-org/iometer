Version 1.1.0 (GA)
==================

- New functionality:
   - (Windows) Support for identifying GPT disks with hidden
     paritions was added.
- Changes/Improvements:
   - (All) Expressing Dynamo command line options with Windows style 
     options (/f) is no longer supported. Going forward, only Unix style 
     options (-f or --foo) are available.
   - (All) Non-standard Dynamo command line options used for tuning
     or activating alternative code paths (-force_raw and -use_rdtsc)
     are now consolidated in the new --flag option.
- Bug fixes:
   - (Linux) The O_DIRECT flag was reintroducted for opening targets
     under Linux. 
   - (Linux) Patch by Jinpyo Kim enabling the use of libaio on Linux.
     The code path is controlled by IOMTR_SETTING_LINUX_LIBAIO and is
     enabled by default.
   - (Linux) Removed stropts.h include for Linux, as this file is no
     longer available with newer Linux distributions.
   - (OS X) Specialized the OS X makefile (Makefile-OSX.all) into
     Makefile-OSX.ppc and Makefile-OSX.i386, because otherwise builds 
     on x86 are breaking due to the CPU architecture specific timer 
     code.
   - (All) Patch by Ryan Bever to fix the version check being performed 
     when loading a ICF files. The new version format caused the check 
     to fail when loading ICF files that were written by former versions 
     of Iometer (see Bug Tracker ID 3141394).
   - (All) Patch by Daniel Scheibli to fix the PROCESSOR row format in 
     the CSV file output (see Bug Tracker ID 3141400).
- Documentation:
   - Converted Iometer User's Manual from Star Office based file (.sxw)
     to the Open Document Format (.odt)
- Others:
   - (All) Reimplementation of handing of Dynamo command line option 
     handling and the related help output (aka Syntax() function). 
   - (All) Minor changes to the initial puslar output. In particular the
     processor family information were cleaned up.
   - Appended .txt extension to the capital letter files (CHANGELOG etc.)
   - Rework of CHANGELOG file to clarify changes since version 2006.07.27.



Version 1.1.0 (RC1)
===================

- New features:
   - (All) Different data randomization options are now available 
     via a drop down menu in the GUI. Options are: "Repeating bytes", 
     "Pseudo-Random" (used by version 2006.07.27 and older) and
     "Full random".
   - (All) Randomization seeding support (by Ryan Bever) was added to
     define a fixed seed for the random number generator. A fixed seed
     can be specified on a per Manager or per Worker basis in the Disk
     Targets page of the GUI.
   - (All) Additional units for display in the GUI. Alternatives are
     Decimal (SI) based (e.g. 1 MB  = 1000000 bytes) and 
     Binary (IEC) based (e.g. 1 MiB = 1048576 bytes).
   - (Windows) User Access Control (UAC) compliance. Both Iometer and
     Dynamo are Windows Vista (and newer) UAC compliant. Because access
     to certain devices requires explicit administrator privileges,
     Dynamo will cause an UAC pop-up requiring approval (if run as
     Administrator) or the Administrator password (if run as regular
     user). In order to avoid separate UAC pop-ups for each Dynamo 
     being started, Iometer is UAC compliant as well, so that Dynamo
     instances being started via Iometer are inheriting the privileges 
     from Iometer. 
- Changes/Improvements:
   - (All) Structure packing changed and was set to 1 byte allignment.
     It is #pragma pack directive based and gets enabled by setting 
     the FORCE_STRUCT_ALIGN global define. Otherwise the fallback 
     is that the old padding fields are being embedded into the 
     data structures. The GCC specific flags get activated with the 
     GCC_ATTRIBUTE_ALIGN global define.
   - (OS X, Windows) New timer code (by Vedran Degoricija) that uses 
     the high performance counter provided by the OS as default timer.
     The command line argument to force the use of CPU timers (e.g.
     RDTSC on x86) is "use_rdtsc" (without quotes).
   - (Windows) The command line option for forcing the disk detection
     mechanism to consider raw disks with partitions changed from
     /force_raw to "force_raw" (without quotes).
   - (Linux, Windows) Process affinity mask can be given as command line 
     option on Linux and Windows. Within the given mask, the workers are 
     allowed to float between CPU's based on the scheduling done by the 
     OS. The process affinity feature must be activated by enabling the 
     IOMTR_SETTING_CPU_AFFINITY global define. 
- Bug fixes:
   - (All) Fixed the 64 bit support of the offset address in the GUI.
   - (Windows) Fixes to the new disk detection mechanism.
- Documentation:
   - none
- Others:
   - Change of Iometer version numbering scheme from the date based 
     yyyy.mm.dd to the more common sequence based major.minor.revision
     scheme. New versions are indicated by major / minor number changes.
     Bug fixes for a given major.minor version are indicated with an
     increment of the revision number. Compatibility between binaries
     is only quaranteed within the same major.minor.revision sequence.



Version 2008.06.18 (RC1)
========================

- New features:
   - Patch by Kris Murray and Allen Wayne from Intel on randomizing the 
     written data. The previous implementation of writing 0's causes an 
     undesired side effect on some media, especially flash-based devices. 
     The writing of random data creates a realistic workload for these 
     new devices. (Also data pattern will have impact on protocol like 
     iSCSI as well).
- Changes/Improvements:
   - (Windows) New disk detection mechanism that adds (i) volume mount 
     point support, (ii) improved raw disk detection and software raid
     awareness, (iii) improved networking detection and (iv) backward
     compatibility for older versions of Windows. 
     Also the Iometer GUI will show new display names for disks (e.g. 
     inquiry info for raw disks). 
     Raw disks with partitions will be shown when running Dynamo with
     the "/force_raw" command line argument. Iometer will hierarchically 
     chain raw disks to corresponding volumes (if any).
     The above is activated by enabling the USE_NEW_DISCOVERY_MECHANISM 
     global define. As it involves changed common data structures, the
     global define has to be enabled on any other OS platforms as well 
     in order to be able to talk to the Iometer GUI.
   - (Windows) Extended timer source detection. On the x86 platforms 
     the Windows high performance counters are now used. On IA64, 
     attempts are made to use the time stamp counter. Alternatively 
     the Windows high performance counters are used as a the fallback. 
     Using the /no_rdtsc command line option disables the attempt 
     to use the time stamp counter.
   - (Windows) Timer source detection includes the detection of
     variable processor frequencies (e.g. Intel SpeedStep). 
   - (Windows) Process affinity mask given as command line option is 
     used to affinitize the workers. Within the given mask, the workers 
     are now distributed across the specified CPU's in a round robin 
     fashion.
   - (All) Full 64 bit supported of the disk size in the GUI. This 
     includes the specification of the start offset.
   - (All) Structure packing is now realized with compiler directives 
     and set to 8 byte alignment. Therefore it is expected, that structures
     do no longer need padding members. The new mechanism gets activated 
     by enabling the FORCE_STRUCT_ALIGN global define. 
- Bug fixes:
   - (Linux) Patch by Ming Zhang to fix the way to get CPU utilization 
     statistics under Linux.
   - (Linux) Patch by Ming Zhang to get CPU count from /proc/cpuinfo 
     under Linux. Old glibc way is buggy for 64bit Linux and XEN.
- Documentation:
   - Added a simple INSTALL file about how to install iometer and dynamo 
     on various platforms.
- Others:
   - (Windows) New project/solution files. Visual Studio 2005 solution 
     file are available in the .\src\msvc\ directory where also the built 
     binaries will be places. DDK build binaries are to be found in the 
     .\src\ddk\ directory.

     documentation (especially for the Iometer User's Guide).
   - Added a remark into the .../README file (containing additions for
     running Dynamo on a Linux machine with NTPL support).
- Others:
   - Added the source and makefile provided by Vedran Degoricija to get
     the Iometer and Dynamo executable build using the Microsoft Driver
     Development Kit (DDK).



Version 2003.05.10
==================

- Applied patches:
  - iometer-2003.02.15-ResultEndTimeHighRes.patch by Daniel Scheibli
    (modifies the result file output to contain the milliseconds as well).
  - iometer-2003.05.04-CIOB5.patch by Matt Robinson (modifies the mechanisms
    for read and writes in IOMeter so that different buffers are used each
    time to avoid cache line collisions and performance lock-ups with some
    chipsets).
  - iometer-2003.02.15-ResultEndTime.patch by Daniel Scheibli (modifies the
    result file output to append the current timestamp after each block of
    results).
  - iometer-2003.02.15-HandleDummy0.patch by Daniel Scheibli (modifies the
    Get_NI_Counter function to handle interfaces without leading blanks
    (like dummy0) as well).
  - iometer-2003.02.15-NoPipe.patch by Daniel Scheibli (removes the Windows
    Pipes support for communication which simplifies the code).
  - iometer-2003.02.15_Get_NI_Counter.patch by Joe Eiler (brings the
    handling for network interfaces that does not contain statistics in
    /proc/net/dev - as for example with Intel Link Aggreation).    
  - iometer-2003.02.15_Exclude_Filesys.patch by Joe Eiler (additional
    command line parameter for Dynamo to pass into file systems which
    should be hidden).
  - iometer-2003.02.15_Extra_Processor_Info.patch by Joe Eiler (brings new
    processor speed values as well as improvements for the GHz CPU detection).
- Cleanup:
   - Updated the handling of the global debug flag (_DEBUG) in the source
     files (check for platform etc.).
   - Changed LINUX_DEBUG and NDEBUG to _DEBUG which is the generic define
     used for this effort.
   - Dropped different unneeded defines in IOVersion.h
   - Dropped clean_ctlm.c, because we can use the recode tool instead.
   - Merged rdtsc.c into IOTime.cpp
   - Cleaned up some compiler warnings on Solaris
   - Changes NO_LINUX_VI to NO_DYNAMO_VI so Solaris build can use it also
   - Dropped the IOCq.cpp file, because it was empty.
- Documentation:
   - Rewrite of the .../README file (containing additions for the Iometer
     User's Guide as well as text for a future Developers Guide).
- Others:
   - Improved error messages for better support in IOPortTCP.cpp (due to
     the recurrent support requests).
   - Made some minor changes to get Iometer to compile with VC++ 7 (.NET)
     Note: No MSVC++ project files have been checked in, you will have to let
           VC++ convert the project for you.  This worked for fine for me.
   - Added the Wizard.mdb file from the old days (version 1999.10.20).
   - rewrote the Solaris Makefile to match the Linux stuff
   - Added the output of the major and minor number during the detection of
     the sector size (of physical disks).



Version 2003.02.15
==================

- Applied patches:
   - iometer.patch by Matt D. Robinson (ensures, that there is an allocated
     buffer for each worker thread - needed for large amounts of I/O through
     ServerWorks chipsets).
- Bugfixes:
   - Different changes to get Dynamo compiled with gcc 3.2 - in the past there
     was some problem known as cout << hex error (include <sstream> instead of
     include <strstream.h> etc).
   - Modified the sector size detection for physical disks under Linux in that
     way, that major and minor number are recognised (was the major number
     only).
   - Added CPU time in user mode with low priority (nice) to the user mode
     utilization as well as the total CPU utilization.
- Cleanup:
   - Dropped the IOMessage.cpp and IOTest.cpp file, because they are empty.
- Others:
   - Under Linux, NFS devices are now supported by default (in older versions
     they was excluded per default).



Version 2003.02.08
==================

- Applied patches:
   - iometer-initial-datatypes.patch
   - iometer-initial-largefile.patch (allows >2GB files under Linux)
   - proc-speed-fix.txt (addresses the 2 GHz CPU issue)
   - Created Iometer.dsw, Iometer.dsp and Dynamo.dsp by merging the files
     contributed earlier by Matt D. Robinson and Jeffery Bahr (allows to
     compile Iometer and Dynamo under Windows).
- Bugfixes:
   - Added support for the CPU utilization and Interrupts statistic on Linux
- Cleanup:
   - Different changes to Makefile-Linux
- New functionality:
   - Addition parameter for Dynamo (optional), to pass the network name Iometer
     should use to communicate with Dynamo. That way it is possible to run the
     communication over the second NIC for example.
- Others:
   - Added the .../src/res tree as well as the .../Docs tree as found in the
     CVS tree at Sourceforge.
   - Started a Todo list with issues needed to be addressed for the code
     cleanup. The file is named .../TODO.
   - Started a modest documentation of the source structure which can be found
     in .../README.
