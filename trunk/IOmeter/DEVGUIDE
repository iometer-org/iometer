Iometer Developer's Guide

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 Introduction

Starting with the development of Iometer you first have to have access to
the source code. Best is to use the CVS server provided by sourceforge.

If you do not have a change to get this done (restrictive firewall etc.)
you can download the nightly tarball of the CVS respository from:

http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/iometer-cvsroot.tar.bz2

Another good source might be the development snapshots (iometer-devel
package) that you can find in the download area at SourceForge.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Coding style

Right now there is not much to tell, as the source code is still under
consolidation. But you should at least considere the following:

 o Document each change you are doing. For which change ever, you have
   to at least document it in the header of the touched codefile. Put
   the date as well as your name / email address as basic input in
   and describe what you are doing and why you are doing it.
   
   Try to reduce yourself to a realtive short but telling text - if
   you need some examples, then have a look to IOCommon.h.
   
   In case you are doing a more complex change / addition, it is wise
   to at some more documentation at the location of the code itself.
   This helps other people and yourself (if you read your coding a
   few months later!) understanding the purpose, assumptions and the
   implementation itself.
   
   If it is even more relevant, then document it in this file. If in
   doubt, then definitively document it in this file!

 o Use normal tab spacing (tab = 8 spaces).

 o Place the open "{" after the condition (for instance "if(...) {").

 o If you want to mark the code to indicate that something still has
   to be done there - use the "TODO:" token (simular to the "FIXME"
   token in the Linux kernel). Of course it is best if you do not
   have a need for such indicators - meaning you directly go with the
   final version of the code.

 o Make use of the IOMTR_... defines/macros (see further parts of the
   document) and do not create you own FOO_BAR defines.
   
 o If you work with ifdef's that do have an else case, then formulate
   your entire construct that way, that the else case is empty except
   for a new platform.
   
   Lets thing about an example where you wanted to do foo for Netware
   and Unix, but bar for Windows. In this case a single if/else/endif
   is not enough, as introducing a new (4th) operating sytem family
   would potentically brake unnoticed. Therefor it is a must that you
   do the following:
   
   #if defined(IOMTR_OSFAMILY_NETWARE) || defined(IOMTR_OSFAMILY_UNIX)
    // foo
   #elif defined(IOMTR_OSFAMILY_WINDOWS)
    // bar
   #else
    #warning ===> WARNING: You have to do some coding here to get the port done!
   #endif

 o If you are doing ifdefs with multiple conditions, then sort the
   elements in an alphabetic order. The example in before for instance
   is doing that and listing Netware before Unix (as this all gets
   interpreted by the preprocessor, there is no need to tune - in
   terms of most likely first - here).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2 Creating a patch

If you are going to develope some extension to Iometer or provide a new
port, you soon or later will have to create a patch. Therefore it helps
all involved parties enormously if you keep the following things in mind:

 o First of all before starting coding it is a good idea to ask within the
   iometer-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list if someone is already
   working on the changes you wanna go for.
   
 o While coding it is wise to comply with the points outlined in the Coding
   Style section above. One of the most important things here is that you
   document (within the code) what you have changed (and of course why).
   
 o Once you are finished and carefully tested what you did, you might
   go for sending your patch into the free world. The best location for
   submitting a patch is the Patch area of the
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/iometer page. Another alternative is
   to sent this patch to the already mentioned
   iometer-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list. If you are going to
   sent the patch to one of the project managers, then at least CC the
   iometer-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list as well (except there
   is some very good reason for not doing so - can't think of such a
   reason).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Makefile issues

For each of the different supported Unix operating system we have a
independent makefile. You can identify the appropriate one by its name
(the makefile for Linux is named Makefile-Linux and so on).

The most important part is the CFLAGS variable which defines the flags
used while compilation of the sources. Beside the compiler flags you will
find important global defines (-D<key>[=<value>]):

 o IOMTR_OSFAMILY_...
 
   This are global defines to identify the Operating System family:

   IOMTR_OSFAMILY_NETWARE    Any Netware based Operating System
   IOMTR_OSFAMILY_UNIX       Any UNIX, currently Linux and Solaris
   IOMTR_OSFAMILY_WINDOWS    Any Windows based Operating System

   Note: The Operating System family could be autodetected by mapping the
         given IOMTR_OS_... value. But this implies, that every code- and
	 headerfile includes IOCommon.h which is not given at this time.

 o IOMTR_OS_...

   This are global defines to identify the Operating System itself: 
   IOMTR_OS_FREEBSD          FreeBSD, 32 bit *
   IOMTR_OS_LINUX            Linux, 32 bit   
   IOMTR_OS_LINUX64          Linux, 64 bit *
   IOMTR_OS_NETWARE          Novell Netware, 32 bit
   IOMTR_OS_OSX              Mac OS X, 64 bit
   IOMTR_OS_SOLARIS          Sun Solaris (64 bit)
   IOMTR_OS_WIN32            Microsoft Windows, 32 bit
   IOMTR_OS_WIN64            Microsoft Windows, 64 bit
   
   * = Not yet implemented / supported.

 o IOMTR_OSVERSION_...

   This are _no_ global defines, but used in the iomtr_kstat module code,
   so they are listed here as well:
   IOMTR_OSVERSION_LINUX24   Linux, 2.4 kernel
   IOMTR_OSVERSION_LINUX26   Linux, 2.6 kernel   
   
   * = Not yet implemented / supported.

 o IOMTR_CPU_...

   This are global defines to identify the Processor / CPU itself: 
   IOMTR_CPU_ALPHA           Alpa CPU (Digital->Compaq->HP) *
   IOMTR_CPU_I386            Intel x86 processors (32 bit)
   IOMTR_CPU_IA64            Intel Itanium family (64 bit)
   IOMTR_CPU_MIPS            MIPS CPU (used in SGI machines etc.) *
   IOMTR_CPU_PPC             PowerPC processor (Apple machines etc.)
   IOMTR_CPU_SPARC           Sun Sparc processor (64 bit)
   IOMTR_CPU_X86_64          AMD x86 with 64 bit extention and
                             Intel Xeon with EM64T
   IOMTR_CPU_XSCALE          Intel XScale processor
    
   * = Not yet implemented / supported.

 o IOMTR_SETTING_...

   This family of global defines activates parts of the code that are not
   active by default. Such parts of the code can be dangerous or require
   non standard libraries: 
   
   IOMTR_SETTING_CPU_AFFINITY  Enables the CPU affinity support within the
                               coding - currently supported on Linux and
			       Windows only (on other platforms this code
			       does nothing).
   IOMTR_SETTING_GCC_M64       The GCC compiler used for Linux builds have
                               a (GCC) build time option to make pointers
                               and longs 64 bits. Useful only on 64 bit
                               operating systems.
   IOMTR_SETTING_KSTAT_PERCPU  For the Linux kernel module. The kstat kernel
                               structure in some smp Linux version use an
                               alternative structure called 'percpu'.
   IOMTR_SETTING_NO_CPU_KHZ    For the Linux kernel module. A few non i386
                               kernels don't export cpu_khz.
   IOMTR_SETTING_OVERRIDE_FS   DANGER!!! - Additional code for dynamo, which
                               allows it to use a (not mounted) file system
			       partitions as target. Please notice that
			       this destroys the file system and overwrites
			       the contained data!
			       This feature is for the Sun Solaris platform
			       only and gets included when compiling with
			       this global define. To activate it you also
			       have to set a environment variable named
			       IOMTR_SETTING_OVERRIDE_FS
   IOMTR_SETTING_VI_SUPPORT    Adds VI (Virtual Interface Architecture)
                               support to the dynamo executable.   

 o IOMTR_MACRO_...
 
   This family of global defines is not realy relevant to the makefile, but
   we will covere them here as well as this is the best location for them
   (with the current status of this document in mind).
   
   The global defines starting with this prefix are macros in reality. They
   get defined in the IOCommon.h file and cover small functional parts like
   min() / max() for instance. The documentation of the macros that are
   realy implemented, can be found in the close to their definition (in
   the IOCommon.h file).

   IOMTR_MACRO_INTERLOCK_CAST  The different compilers used to build Dynamo
                               can be senitive about parameter type. This
                               macro casts the parameters to the interlocked
                               functions used for thread communication.
   
 o _DEBUG

   This is the global "switch" to activate the debugging code.  
   
   Note: We can not change its name to DEBUG for instance, because
         the MFC Library (Windows only) gets into debugging mode when
	 _DEBUG is defined, so we have to stick with it. Another option
	 is to use our own DEBUG define and then activate _DEBUG using
	 a #ifdef statement (something for the IOCommon.h file).

 o _GALILEO_ / _PULSAR_

   This are two global defines to distinguish Iometer (_GALILEO_) from
   Dynamo (_PULSAR_) parts in the code. For instance this "switches" are
   used to define if error messages are prompted as Message Box or
   directly printed to the console.

4 Porting Iometer

Since Iometer is an Open Source project, there was/are different ports under
way. If you are interested in porting to a new Operating System/Processor
combination, the following mail - containing a first starting point - might
be of interest to you:

To: ...
Subject: Re: Iometer
 
Hi,

well I think the first steps could be to download the latest
CVS tree stuff.

There I applied some big patches which brings the so called
IOMTR_* defines (described in the second part of the README
file). So that way you could create a new IOMTR_OS_* define
for <OS/> (in the README and the IOCommon.h file), choose
the proper IOMTR_OSFAMILY_* define [1] and create a Makefile
for <OS/>.

Then I would do a first compile - for shure it will not work,
but that way you can easily identify most of the locations in
the code where you might have to do something. This comes due
to the "#warning" stuff which is everywhere in the code where
we have a code inclusion based on IOMTR_OS_*, IOMTR_OSFAMILY_*
or IOMTR_CPU_*.

>From there you could start extending this "#if / #elif" clauses
(most of the times it will be just adding IOMTR_OS_<OS/> to the
Unix fraction). The most prominent needs for coding I see

- <OS/> specific include files
- Asynchronous I/O (there are Windows API
  calls or a emulation for Linux / Solaris)
- The time-measurement (for i386 we do
  RDTSC calls which might differ in the
  way of how to do this call for <OS/>.
  You also have to ensure that the CPU
  speed in MHz is detected properly)

I think thats basically it - at least what comes to my mind
first. If you are realy going for it (I would love to see and
support it), then for shure we can go more into details.

Looking forward to hear from you.

In general it can be said, that the efforts for porting Dynamo depends on
the possibilities of reuse.

 - Operating System Family - Adding a new Operating System Family can eat
   up a lot of effort. The good news is that Unix and Windows are already
   in, so we do not expect to see that much new platforms.

 - Operating System - If the Operating System fits into an already
   supported Operting System Family the most effort was already done
   for you.

 - Processor Family - Supporting another processor mostly requires the
   handling of endianess and the time measurement (using the RDTSC
   instruction under I386 for instance).

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

A File descriptions

In the following two subchapters you will find a lists with descriptions
for each file within the source tarball (grouped by there primary job).

One of the few common rules within the Iometer / Dynamo source seems to
be, that once a class is defined and implemented, you will find the class
defintion in foo.h and its implementation in foo.cpp.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.1 Iometer

 o Central configuration

    - IOCommon.h               (<none>)

      This is THE central header file of the project. It contains basic
      settings for Iometer as well as Dynamo. Limits like MAX_WORKERS
      or MAX_TARGETS are defined here.

    - IOVersion.h              (<none>)

      The primary job of this file is to set the version string
      (IOVER_FILEVERSION) as well as other descriptive stuff.

      Keep in mind, that once you have changed the version string, you
      have to compile both Iometer and Dynamo - otherwise the login (which
      is done at Dynamo startup) will fail.

 o Core code

    - GalileoApp.h             (CGalileoApp)
    - GalileoApp.cpp           (CGalileoApp)

      The CGalileoApp class is THE central class of Iometer - it is simular
      to the main() function of traditional C programs.

    - ManagerList.h 
    - ManagerList.cpp 

      The ManagerList class gets instantited by the CGalileoApp class. It
      represents a list of Manager class instances.

    - Manager.h 
    - Manager.cpp 

      The Manager class represents a single instance of an single manager
      (which is a running instance of the Dynamo executable). Do not get
      confused, due to the fact, that Dynamo has an Manager class as well.
      Both are talking about the same subject, but contains different coding.
      
 o Helping code (User Interface)

    - LegalBox.h               (CLegalBox)
    - LegalBox.cpp             (CLegalBox)

    - GalileoView.h            (CGalileoView)
    - GalileoView.cpp          (CGalileoView)
    
      This class manages and contains the overall GUI stuff. It is a large
      file containing a mixture of GUI handling and core functionality.
      Beside other things, it contains the AddDefaultWorkers() method which
      is responsible to add the number of disk and network workers (the
      numbers are specified in the "Test setup" tab of the Iometer GUI).
    
    - MainFrm.h                (CMainFrame)
    - MainFrm.cpp              (CMainFrame)    

    - PageDisk.h               (CPageDisk)
    - PageDisk.cpp             (CPageDisk)    
    - PageNetwork.h            (CPageNetwork)
    - PageNetwork.cpp          (CPageNetwork)
    - PageTarget.h             (<none>)
    - PageAccess.h             (CPageAccess)
    - PageAccess.cpp           (CPageAccess)
    - PageDisplay.h            (CPageDisplay)
    - PageDisplay.cpp          (CPageDisplay)
      ...

    - PageSetup.h              (CPageSetup)
    - PageSetup.cpp            (CPageSetup)

      Responsible for the "Test Setup" tab of the Iometer GUI. Beside the
      coding for user interaction, you find the default settings within the
      OnInitDialog() method.
      The number of disk and network workers per manager is defined here
      too. The defaults differ between debug code and release code.      

    - AccessDialog.h           (CAccessDialog)
    - AccessDialog.cpp         (CAccessDialog)

      Responsible for the "Access Specification" dialog in the Iometer GUI.
      The SetSize() function for instance is setting the size of the
      Transfer Requests based on the three sliding listboxes (MB, KB, Bytes).

    - BigMeter.h               (CBigMeter)
    - BigMeter.cpp             (CBigMeter)
    - MeterCtrl.h              (CMeterCtrl)
    - MeterCtrl.cpp            (CMeterCtrl)
    ...
 
 o Helping code (Rest of)

    - GalileoDefs.h            (<none>)
    - GalileoGlobals.cpp       (<none>)

    - GalileoCmdLine.h         (<none>)
    - GalileoCmdLine.cpp       (<none>)

    - AccessSpecList.cpp       (AccessSpecList)

      Implements the Global Access Specifications list shown in the dialog
      with the same name. This list contains "Idle", "Default" and a number
      of samples ready to use.

    - GalileoDoc.h
    - GalileoDoc.cpp
    - ICF_ifstream.h
    - ICF_ifstream.cpp

    ...

    - Galileo.rc              (<none>)
    - resource.h              (<none>)
    - res/Iometer.rc2         (<none>)

      This resource and there header files which are needed to compile the
      executable for Windows.

    - Iometer.dsw             (<none>)
    - Iometer.dsp             (<none>)

      Both Workspace and Project file are used to compile the Iometer code
      with Microsoft Developer / Visual Studio.

    - Iometer/makefile        (<none>)
    - Iometer/sources         (<none>)

      Files needed to build the Iometer GUI executable with the Microsoft
      Driver Development Kit.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.2 Dynamo

 o Central configuration

    - IOCommon.h               (<none>)

      This is THE central header file of the project. It contains basic
      settings for Iometer as well as Dynamo. Limits like MAX_WORKERS
      or MAX_TARGETS are defined here.

    - IOVersion.h              (<none>)

      The primary job of this file is to set the version string
      (IOVER_FILEVERSION) as well as other descriptive stuff.

      Keep in mind, that once you have changed the version string, you
      have to compile both Iometer and Dynamo - otherwise the login
      (which is done at Dynamo startup) will fail.

 o Core code

    - Pulsar.cpp              (<none>)

      This is THE central code file of Dynamo, housing the essential
      main() function.      

    - IOManager.h             (Manager)
    - IOManager.cpp           (Manager)
    - IOManagerLinux.cpp      (Manager)
    - IOManagerSolaris.cpp    (Manager)      
      
      The Manager class is Dynamo's main class and is instantiated by
      the main() function (see Pulsar.cpp).

      IOManager.cpp implements the platform independent as well as the
      Windows related stuff.
      IOManagerLinux.cpp and IOManagerSolaris.cpp contains coding related
      to that platforms - the differenciation is done by cheating with
      defines.

    - IOGrunt.h               (Grunt)
    - IOGrunt.cpp             (Grunt)

      The Grunt class represents an Worker thread and is instantiated up
      to MAX_WORKERS (see IOCommon.h) times per Manager class object. 

    - IOTarget.h              (Target)
    - IOTarget.cpp            (Target)

    - IOTargetVI.cpp          (TargetVI)

      The Target class is a virtual class that represents Worker Targets.
      The TargetDisk, TargetTCP and TargetVI classes are based on that
      and covers the target specific implementation.
      They are instantiated up to MAX_TARGETS (see IOCommon.h) times per
      Grunt class object.

    - IOAccess.h              (IOAccess)
    - IOAccess.cpp            (IOAccess)
    
      The Access class represents the current Access Specifications for
      a Worker. An object contains up to MAX_ACCESS_SPECS (see IOAccess.h)
      Access Specification lines (each represented by a ACCESS struct).

    - IOTransfers.h           (<none>)

    - IOPortTCP.h             (PortTCP)
    - IOPortTCP.cpp           (PortTCP)

      The job of the Port class is to handle the communication between
      Iometer and Dynamo. PortTCP is implementing the supported to do
      so. Instantiation is done by the Manager class.
 
    - IOMessage.h             (<none>)
    - IOTest.h                (<none>)

      the communication between Iometer and Dynamo.

    - Network.h               (Network)
    - Network.cpp             (Network)
    - NetTCP.h                (NetAsyncTCP)
    - NetTCP.cpp              (NetAsyncTCP)
    - NetVI.h                 (NetVI)
    - NetVI.cpp               (NetVI)

      The Network class is a virtual class which covers the communication
      between network workers in Dynamo. The NetAsyncTCP and NetVI class
      are based on that and covers the media specific implementation.
      Instantiation is done by one of the Target classes.

    - ByteOrder.cpp           (<none>)

      This code file implements the reorder() function, which is used in
      big endian environments (Sun Sparc processor for example) to swap
      the byte order. 

 o Helping code (Performance)

    - IOPerformance.h         (Performance)
    - IOPerformance.cpp       (Performance)
    - IOPerformanceLinux.cpp  (Performance)

      The Performance class is responsible for providing basic informations
      as the number of CPU's and their speed. But its primary job is the
      collection and calculation of system-wide performance figures as for
      example the CPU utilization.

      The platform independent coding as well as the Windows and Solaris
      related stuff can be found in IOPerformance.cpp, while the Linux
      related coding is kept in IOPerformanceLinux.cpp - the seperation is
      done by cheating with defines.

    - IOTime.cpp              (<none>)
    
      This files contains the different implementations for reading the 
      processors high resolution timers.
      
 o Helping code (Rest of)

    - IOCQ.h                  (CQ)
    - IOCQAIO.h               (CQAIO)
    - IOCQAIO.cpp             (CQAIO)
    - IOCQVI.h                (CQVI)
    - IOCQVI.cpp              (CQVI)
    - IOCompletionQ.cpp       (<none>)

      The CQ class (Completion Queue) is a virtual class which is used
      to manage completions. The CQAIO class covers the TargetDisk and
      TargetTCP objects, CQVI is used for TargetVI objects.

      IOCompletionQ.cpp houses the UNIX implementation of several
      Windows NT key functions for asynchronous I/O.

    - IOVIPL.h                (VIPL)
    - IOVIPL.cpp              (VIPL)
    - VINic.h                 (VINic)
    - VINic.cpp               (VINic)
    - vipl.h                  (<none>)

      The VIPL class is a wrapper for all the functions of the VI Provider
      Library. It is used by the VINic class to abstracts the VI NIC's.
      The vipl.h header file contains all the VI specific type definitions,
      structs, enums etc.

    - Pulsar.rc               (<none>)
    - PulsarRC.h              (<none>)
